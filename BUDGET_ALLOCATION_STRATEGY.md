# Best Budget Allocation Strategy - $22/Day
## Based on Current Performance Data (January 2026)

**Total Budget:** $22/day = $660/month  
**Current Status:** Avondale performing, Surprise needs fixes, other cities untested

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED STRATEGY: Performance-Based Split

### **Phase 1: Immediate (Next 2-3 Weeks) - Fix & Test**
Focus on proven performer (Avondale) and fix Surprise for fair comparison.

| City | Daily Budget | Weekly Total | Rationale |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Avondale** | **$11.00** | **$77.00** | ✅ Proven converter - 1 conversion, winner keyword identified |
| **Surprise** | **$11.00** | **$77.00** | 🔧 Fix winner keyword + equal test budget to determine viability |
| **All Others** | **$0.00** | **$0.00** | ⏸️ Pause until Avondale/Surprise results are clear |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.00** | **$154.00** | |

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Gives Surprise fair chance to prove itself (currently only $2/day - too low to test)
- ✅ Scales proven winner (Avondale) while testing Surprise
- ✅ Stops spending on untested cities until we know what works
- ✅ Faster decision-making (2-3 weeks vs 8 weeks of rotation)

**After 2-3 Weeks:**
- If Surprise converts → Keep both at $11/day, then add rotation for other cities
- If Surprise doesn't convert → Move Surprise to minimal ($1-2/day), increase Avondale to $15/day, start rotation

---

### **Phase 2: After Surprise Decision (Weeks 4-8) - Rotation for Testing**

Once we know if Surprise works, use rotation to test remaining cities:

#### **Option A: If Surprise Works** (Both Avondale & Surprise convert)

**Rotation Budget Split:**
| City | Daily Budget | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Avondale** | **$8.00** | Maintain proven performer |
| **Surprise** | **$8.00** | Maintain proven performer |
| **Rotation City** | **$5.00** | Test one new city per week |
| **All Others** | **$1.00** | Keep campaigns active (minimal) |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.00** | |

**8-Week Rotation for New Cities:**
- Week 1: Goodyear ($5/day) | Weeks 2-3: Buckeye, Glendale, etc.
- Each untested city gets 1 week of $5/day budget to test

#### **Option B: If Surprise Doesn't Work** (Only Avondale converts)

**Performance-Focused Split:**
| City | Daily Budget | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **Avondale** | **$12.00** | Scale proven winner |
| **Surprise** | **$1.00** | Minimal presence (test if fixes worked later) |
| **Rotation City** | **$8.00** | Test one new city per week |
| **All Others** | **$1.00** | Keep campaigns active (minimal) |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.00** | |

**Focus on West Valley first:**
- Week 1: Goodyear ($8/day)
- Week 2: Buckeye ($8/day)
- Week 3: Glendale ($8/day)
- Week 4: Peoria ($8/day)
- Then test East Valley cities if time/budget allows

## 📊 COMPARISON: Rotation vs. Performance-Based

### **Rotation Strategy (8-Week Cycle):**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Fair testing for all cities
- ✅ Good for gathering data on all markets

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Takes 8 weeks to see results
- ⚠️ Wastes budget on cities that don't convert
- ⚠️ Reduces budget for proven performers (Avondale)
- ⚠️ Weekly manual updates required

**Best For:** When you have no performance data yet

---

### **Performance-Based Strategy (Recommended):**
**Pros:**
- ✅ Maximizes ROI on proven performers (Avondale)
- ✅ Faster decision-making (2-3 weeks vs 8 weeks)
- ✅ Focuses budget where it works
- ✅ Still tests new cities via rotation, but prioritizes winners

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Requires performance data (which you have)

**Best For:** When you have performance data (like now)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Hybrid Strategy

### **Right Now (Next 2-3 Weeks):**
**Equal Split:** Avondale $11/day + Surprise $11/day = $22/day total

**Why:**
1. Avondale is proven - needs budget to scale
2. Surprise needs fair test (currently only $2/day - can't tell if it works)
3. Fix Surprise winner keyword during this period
4. Make decision after 2-3 weeks based on data

---

### **After 2-3 Weeks (Decision Time):**

#### **If Surprise Converts:**
**Budget Split:**
- Avondale: $8/day (proven)
- Surprise: $8/day (proven)
- Rotation: $5/day (test new cities weekly)
- Others: $1/day (keep active)

**Rotation Priority (West Valley First):**
1. Goodyear (home base)
2. Buckeye (growing market)
3. Glendale (large market)
4. Peoria (West Valley)
5. Then East Valley cities if budget/time allows

---

#### **If Surprise Doesn't Convert:**
**Budget Split:**
- Avondale: $12/day (scale winner)
- Surprise: $1/day (minimal, test later)
- Rotation: $8/day (test new cities weekly)
- Others: $1/day (keep active)

**Focus on West Valley:**
- Goodyear, Buckeye, Glendale, Peoria get priority
- Test with $8/day for 1 week each
- If one converts, increase budget, reduce rotation

## 💰 BUDGET EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS

### **Current Performance Data:**

**Avondale Campaign:**
- **CPC:** $9.92 (efficient)
- **Conversion Rate:** 7.69% (13 clicks, 1 conversion)
- **Cost per Conversion:** $128.92 (will improve with optimization)
- **Winner Keyword:** `[avondale property management]` - 14.29% conv rate (7 clicks, 1 conversion)
- **At $11/day:** ~1.1 clicks/day = ~3-4 clicks/week = ~1 conversion every 2-3 weeks
- **At $12/day:** ~1.2 clicks/day = ~4 clicks/week = ~1 conversion every 2 weeks

**Surprise Campaign:**
- **CPC:** $7.00 (lower than Avondale - potentially more efficient)
- **Conversion Rate:** 0% (need data - only 3 clicks total)
- **At $11/day:** ~1.6 clicks/day = ~5 clicks/week = enough data to determine viability
- **Need:** Fix winner keyword first, then test

---

## 📋 ACTION PLAN

### **This Week:**
1. ✅ **Fix Surprise winner keyword** (critical - 0% CTR)
2. ✅ **Set budgets:** Avondale $11/day, Surprise $11/day
3. ✅ **Pause all other cities** (or set to $0.25/day minimum to keep active)

### **Weeks 2-3:**
4. ✅ **Monitor both campaigns daily**
5. ✅ **Track conversions** (does Surprise convert after fix?)
6. ✅ **Make decision after 2-3 weeks**

### **Week 4+ (Based on Results):**
**If Surprise Works:**
- Keep both at $8/day
- Start rotation with $5/day for new cities
- Priority: Goodyear, Buckeye, Glendale, Peoria

**If Surprise Doesn't Work:**
- Avondale: $12/day (scale winner)
- Surprise: $1/day (minimal)
- Rotation: $8/day for new cities (Goodyear first)

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS THE BEST STRATEGY

### **1. Data-Driven Decisions**
- Uses actual performance data (Avondale converting)
- Tests Surprise properly (not enough budget before)
- Makes decisions faster (2-3 weeks vs 8 weeks)

### **2. Maximizes ROI**
- Focuses budget on proven performers (Avondale)
- Stops wasting on untested cities until we know what works
- Scales winners before testing new markets

### **3. Still Tests All Markets**
- Rotation happens after we know what works
- Tests new cities with adequate budget ($5-8/day)
- Prioritizes West Valley (where your properties are)

### **4. Flexible & Adaptive**
- Adjusts based on results
- Can shift budget quickly if one city converts
- Doesn't lock you into 8-week cycle if data shows clear winner

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Don't Spread Budget Too Thin:**
- $22/day ÷ 10 cities = $2.20/day each
- At $12 CPC, that's only ~0.18 clicks/day per city = 1 click every 5-6 days
- **Too thin to get meaningful data or conversions**

### **Focus Wins Over Spread:**
- Better to get 1 conversion from Avondale at $11/day than 0 conversions from 10 cities at $2/day each
- Once you find 2-3 winners, then add rotation for discovery

### **Key Insight:**
**"Find your winners first, then test broadly"**  
Not: "Test everything at once with tiny budgets"

---

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS

### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-3): Avondale + Surprise Focus**
- **Avondale:** ~2-3 conversions/month (at $11/day)
- **Surprise:** Either 0 conversions (reduce budget) or 2-3 conversions (keep equal)
- **Total:** 2-6 conversions/month
- **Cost per Conversion:** $80-110 (improving from $149.91)

### **Phase 2 (Weeks 4+): Winner + Rotation**
**If Both Work:**
- **Avondale + Surprise:** ~4-6 conversions/month combined
- **Rotation City:** ~1 conversion every 4-6 weeks (testing phase)
- **Total:** 5-7 conversions/month

**If Only Avondale Works:**
- **Avondale:** ~3-4 conversions/month (at $12/day)
- **Rotation City:** ~1 conversion every 3-4 weeks (testing phase)
- **Total:** 4-5 conversions/month + discovery of new winner

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

**Start with:** Avondale $11/day + Surprise $11/day  
**After 2-3 weeks:** Make decision based on Surprise performance  
**Then:** Add rotation for new cities, but keep budget on winners

**This is the most efficient use of $22/day based on your current performance data.**
