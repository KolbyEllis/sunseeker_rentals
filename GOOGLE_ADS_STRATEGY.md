## ⚙️ BIDDING STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Weeks 1-2 (Learning Phase)
- **Strategy**: Manual CPC
- **Bid**: Start at $2.00-$3.50 per click (based on city)
- **Goal**: Gather conversion data
- **Action**: Monitor search terms, adjust bids daily

### Phase 2: Weeks 3-4 (Optimization Phase)
- **Strategy**: Target CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)
- **Target CPA**: $100-$150 per lead (based on $3k/year customer value)
  - **Math**: $3k customer value ÷ 20% conversion rate = $600 max CPA
  - **Target**: $100-$150 per lead = 20-30x ROI (conservative target)
  - **Aggressive**: Can go up to $200-$300 per lead if conversion rate is high
- **Goal**: Optimize for conversions
- **Action**: Let Google optimize, review daily

### Phase 3: Month 2+ (Automated Phase)
- **Strategy**: Maximize Conversions (within budget)
- **Target**: 12-20 leads per month total (3-5 customers at 20-25% close rate)
- **Goal**: Consistent lead flow
- **Action**: Weekly review, adjust budgets as needed

---

## 📍 TARGETING SETTINGS

### Location Targeting

**West Valley Cities (Primary Focus):**
- **Method**: People in or regularly in these locations
- **Radius**: Include within 15 miles of each West Valley city center (Goodyear, Glendale, Peoria, Avondale, Surprise, Buckeye, Litchfield Park)

- **Reason**: Local presence = faster response, deeper knowledge, better service

**East Valley/Metro Cities (Secondary):**
- **Method**: People in or regularly in these locations
- **Radius**: Include within 10 miles of each city center (Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Tempe)
- **Priority**: Standard bids (no adjustment)
- **Reason**: Still serve these areas, but West Valley is focus

**Exclusions**: None (keep broad for now, but monitor for irrelevant locations)

### Device Targeting
- **Mobile**: +20% bid adjustment (mobile-first approach)
- **Tablet**: 0% bid adjustment
- **Desktop**: 0% bid adjustment

### Schedule/Ad Schedule
- **Days**: Monday-Friday (9am-5pm focus)
- **Bid Adjustment**: +10% during business hours (9am-4pm)
