## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

### 1. **High CPC on Non-Converting Keyword** 🚨
**`[property management avondale az]` (Exact match):**
- **CPC:** $19.78 (89% higher than your winner keyword!)
- **CTR:** 12.50% (decent but lower than winner)
- **Clicks:** 1 click
- **Conversions:** 0 (0% conversion rate)
- **Cost:** $19.78 wasted
- **Problem:** Paying 89% more than your winner, getting no conversions
- **Recommendation:** ⬇️ **LOWER BID from $7.00 to $5.00** to test if it can convert at lower cost

### 2. **Keywords with 0 Activity**
**These keywords have 0 impressions after 11 days:**
- `[avondale property manager]` - $2.00 bid (too low?)
- `[property management avondale arizona]` - $2.00 bid (too low?)
- `"property management services avondale"` - $2.00 bid
- `"avondale rental property management"` - $2.00 bid
- `"property management avondale company"` - $2.00 bid

**Recommendation:**
- **Option A:** Increase bids to $3-4 to see if they get activity
- **Option B:** Pause them if they're truly redundant with active keywords
- **Current status:** Not generating any traffic = wasted bid management

### 3. **"Rarely Served" Keywords**
**These keywords are marked "rarely served" (0 impressions):**
- `"avondale property management near me"`
- `"property management avondale reviews"`
- `"property management near avondale"`
- `"best property management avondale"`
- `"find property manager avondale"`
- `"hire property manager avondale"`
- `"how to find property manager avondale"`
- `"best property manager avondale"`
- `"avondale property management reviews"`

**Recommendation:** ⏸️ **PAUSE ALL** - These are wasting account management time with zero potential

### 4. **Low Conversion Volume**
- **Total Conversions:** Only 1 conversion in 11 days
- **Issue:** Need more conversions to determine what works
- **Cause:** Low click volume (only 13 clicks total)
- **Recommendation:** Increase budget or bids to get more clicks on winner keyword

### 5. **High Cost Per Conversion**
- **Current:** $128.92 per conversion
- **Target:** Should be $60-80 based on your $12 CPC, 20% conversion rate
- **Issue:** Paying more than ideal because of wasted spend on non-converters
- **Solution:** Lower bids on non-converters, increase budget for winner keyword

### 6. **"Other Search Terms" Not Converting**
- **Other search terms:** 7 clicks, 0 conversions (0% conversion rate)
- **Cost:** $52.23 wasted on non-converting terms
- **Issue:** Need to see what these search terms are (may need to add negative keywords)
