                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    We own a home in Avondale and being a military family, we are always moving. Currently living in Washington and renters moving out of our house, left us looking for new property management and renters. They helped us every step of the way and were so willing to work with out situation. I never imagined things would be so easy and streamlined. They worked hard to find the right fit for our home and we felt comfortable leaving our own in their hands. My husband and I appreciate them so much and so happy that we were able to find them! We had a previous PM horror story, but Cindi and Ken were nothing like that and restored our faith in people. A true blessing! COMMUNICATION was always important and boy are they great at it!!

                    Ken and Cindi have been my rental managers for 5 years and they are awesome...no other way to express how professional, hardworking and responsive they are. I have had a couple of very difficult situations with tenants and because I live three states away they have been a godsend. They immediately responded to the situations, got to work on them, kept in touch with me all along the way and saved me huge amounts of money that I otherwise would have lost. Besides being so professional they are WONDERFUL people. If you are looking for rental managers they are the people you want and you won't be disappointed.

                    If you're looking for an outstanding, professional property management team, look no further than Cindi & Kenneth. They've managed our property for nearly 3 years and we've had nothing but a positive experience. They're responsive and answer any of our questions in a timely manner. In addition, they quickly inform us if there are any issues which require our approval to resolve. Lastly, they provide an outstanding end-of-year financial statement which greatly helps come tax time.

                <p class="cs-item-text">
                    Ken and Cindi are wonderful to work with. We were having many issues with another management company in regards to our rental home and them not keeping up with the care of our property and ignoring our phone calls and emails. Ken and Cindi stepped right in and solved all of our issues immediately. They have a great working relationship with our tenants and respond quickly with a call or an email when there is an issue. They are very nice people and really care about your property unlike other companies that are just in it for a check. In addition they also take care of our personal vacation home in Arizona. We never have to worry about our properties and are very confident with them. We would highly recommend them to anybody looking for a property manager and someone to trust with their home.
