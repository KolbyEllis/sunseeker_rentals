Working with Ken & Cindy Ellis of SunSeeker Rentals has been an exceptionally easy and highly positive experience! I would recommend them, without hesitation, to anyone needing their expertise. This is a very straightforward business with years of experience. Response time to questions or concerns is impressively fast and professionally handled. Prices are fair and competitive. Questions are answered honestly and completely. I have also had timely and excellent help from any of the service providers that Ken has recommended. SunSeeker Rentals is just an excellent business!
