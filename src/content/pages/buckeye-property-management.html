                <p class="cs-faq-text">
                    Buckeye's rapid growth and new construction create unique opportunities. Rental demand is exceptionally strong due to population growth, but property owners need managers familiar with new home systems, HOA requirements in master-planned communities, and the specific appeal of neighborhoods like Verrado and Sundance.
