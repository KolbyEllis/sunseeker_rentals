Hi [Boss Name],

I wanted to share an opportunity that came across my desk regarding a paid listing on The Phoenix Review's "Best Property Management Companies in Phoenix" page. They're offering position #2 for $500 per year, and I've reviewed the traffic analytics they provided.

The page receives about 4,800 page views per year, which translates to roughly 13 visitors per day. More importantly, they're showing a 42% click-through rate with over 2,000 total clicks in the past year, which indicates strong user engagement. The analytics show that visitors are actively researching property management services, which suggests these are qualified prospects rather than casual browsers.

From a cost perspective, this would be significantly cheaper than our current Google Ads spend. Our best-performing keyword costs around $10 per click, while this listing would likely cost between $1.25 and $2.50 per click depending on how many clicks position #2 actually receives. The challenge is that we don't know exactly how many of those 2,000 clicks would go to position #2 versus the other listings on the page. If we assume position #2 gets 10-15% of the clicks, we're looking at roughly 200-300 clicks per year, which makes the cost per click very competitive compared to paid search.

There are also SEO benefits to consider. The listing includes a dofollow backlink from a local Phoenix domain, which could help with our local search rankings. Additionally, appearing on a "best of" list provides credibility and brand visibility that goes beyond just the direct traffic.

However, there are some concerns worth noting. Unlike Google Ads where we can track conversions precisely, we won't have the same level of visibility into how many leads this listing actually generates. We'd need to ask new leads how they found us to measure ROI, which isn't as reliable as our current tracking methods. There's also the risk that if the site's traffic or authority declines over time, the value of our investment decreases. We're also committing to an annual fee upfront, so if it doesn't perform well, we're locked in for the full year.

The opportunity cost is another factor. That $500 could alternatively fund about 42 days of our current Google Ads budget, where we have proven tracking and can optimize in real-time. We could also invest that money in free local citations, content creation, or other marketing channels that might provide better long-term value.

Given that we're currently operating on a limited Google Ads budget of $12 per day, this listing could be a cost-effective way to supplement our lead generation. If position #2 generates even 5-10 qualified leads per year, and our average client value is strong, this could be a profitable investment. The main uncertainty is not knowing exactly how many clicks we'd receive in position #2 versus the other listings.

I'd recommend we test this for one year if we have budget flexibility, with the understanding that we'll need to track leads manually to measure ROI. If it generates solid results, we can renew. If not, we've learned something valuable about this channel for a relatively low cost compared to other marketing investments.

Let me know your thoughts on whether this fits into our marketing budget and strategy.
