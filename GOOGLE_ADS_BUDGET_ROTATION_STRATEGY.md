## 🔄 EXTENDED ROTATION (8-Week Full Cycle)

After 4 weeks, continue rotation with remaining cities:

**Week 5: Glendale Emphasis**  
**Week 6: Peoria Emphasis**  
**Week 7: Litchfield Park Emphasis**  
**Week 8: Phoenix Emphasis** (then back to Week 1)

This ensures all cities get equal emphasis testing over 8 weeks.

## 🎯 WEST VALLEY PRIORITY (74% of Budget)

### West Valley Cities Get 2x Emphasis Weeks:
- **Goodyear** (Week 2) - Home base, rank #16 organically
- **Buckeye** (Week 1) - Growing West Valley market
- **Avondale** (Week 3) - Already has performance data
- **Surprise** (Week 4) - West Valley, strong demand
- **Glendale** (Week 5) - West Valley anchor city
- **Peoria** (Week 6) - West Valley, growing market
- **Litchfield Park** (Week 7) - Premium West Valley market

**West Valley Total:** 7 weeks out of 8 = 87.5% emphasis  
**East Valley Total:** 1 week (Phoenix) = 12.5% emphasis

---

## 💰 HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE ROTATION

### Option 1: Manual Weekly Updates (Recommended for Start)
1. **Every Monday morning**, update campaign budgets in Google Ads
2. Set emphasis city to **$12/day**
3. Set other cities to minimal budgets ($0.25 - $2.00/day)
4. Keep a calendar reminder

### Option 2: Google Ads Scripts (Advanced)
- Automate budget changes with Google Ads scripts
- Script runs weekly and adjusts budgets automatically
- Requires technical setup but runs hands-free

### Option 3: Shared Budgets (Alternative)
- Create shared budgets for emphasis cities
- Manually switch which campaign uses the shared budget
- Less precise but easier to manage

---

## 📈 EXPECTED RESULTS BY WEEK

### Emphasis Week (City gets $12/day):
- **Clicks/week:** ~7 clicks (1 click/day)
- **At 20% conversion rate:** ~1.4 conversions/week
- **Cost per conversion:** ~$60 (based on $12 CPC, 20% conv rate)

### Minimal Budget Weeks (City gets $1-2/day):
- **Clicks/week:** ~1-2 clicks total
- **Purpose:** Keep campaign active, gather baseline data
- **No conversions expected** (too few clicks)

### Monthly Totals (4-week cycle):
- **Total clicks:** ~35-40 clicks/month
- **Total conversions:** ~6-8 conversions/month (assuming 20% rate)
- **Total cost:** ~$660/month
- **Cost per conversion:** ~$82-110/conversion

---

## 🔍 MONITORING & OPTIMIZATION

### Track Weekly:
1. **Clicks per city** (should see spikes on emphasis weeks)
2. **Conversions per city** (which cities convert best?)
3. **CPC trends** (are they staying around $12?)
4. **Quality Score** (is it improving over time?)

### After 8 Weeks:
1. **Analyze which cities converted best**
2. **Adjust rotation** to give more weeks to best performers
3. **Consider increasing budget** for top 2-3 cities
4. **Reduce budget** for cities with zero conversions

### Optimization Rule:
- **If city converts during emphasis week:** Give it 2 weeks next cycle
- **If city has zero conversions after 2 emphasis weeks:** Reduce to minimal budget only
- **If city has 3+ conversions in emphasis week:** Consider making it permanent emphasis

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS

### Pros of Rotation Strategy:
- ✅ Tests all markets with equal budget
- ✅ Gathers data on all cities
- ✅ Focuses budget on one city at a time (better than spreading thin)
- ✅ Allows Google Ads to learn each city campaign

### Cons of Rotation Strategy:
- ⚠️ Can take 8 weeks to see full results
- ⚠️ Requires weekly manual updates (unless using scripts)
- ⚠️ Cities with minimal budget won't get much data

### Alternative: Static Allocation (If Rotation Too Complex)

If rotation is too much work, use static allocation:

**West Valley Focus (Static):**
| City | Daily Budget | % of Total |
|------|--------------|------------|
| Goodyear | $5.00 | 22.7% |
| Avondale | $3.00 | 13.6% |
| Buckeye | $3.00 | 13.6% |
| Glendale | $2.50 | 11.4% |
| Peoria | $2.50 | 11.4% |
| Surprise | $2.50 | 11.4% |
| Litchfield Park | $2.00 | 9.1% |
| Phoenix | $1.50 | 6.8% |
| Mesa | $0.25 | 1.1% |
| Chandler | $0.25 | 1.1% |
| **TOTAL** | **$22.00** | **100%** |

This spreads budget but less efficient than rotation.

## 🎯 RECOMMENDATION

**Start with Weekly Rotation** for first 8 weeks to gather data, then switch to **static allocation** based on which cities convert best.

**Month 1-2:** Use rotation strategy (gather data)  
**Month 3+:** Switch to static allocation with budget weighted to best performers

---

## 📋 QUICK REFERENCE: WEEKLY BUDGET CHANGES

### Every Monday, set these budgets:

**Week 1 (Buckeye):**  
- Buckeye: $12/day | All others: $1-2/day

**Week 2 (Goodyear):**  
- Goodyear: $12/day | All others: $1-2/day

**Week 3 (Avondale):**  
- Avondale: $12/day | All others: $1-2/day

**Week 4 (Surprise):**  
- Surprise: $12/day | All others: $1-2/day

**Continue rotation...**

**Remember:** The goal is to find which cities convert best, then allocate more budget to winners. Rotation ensures fair testing, then you optimize based on data!
