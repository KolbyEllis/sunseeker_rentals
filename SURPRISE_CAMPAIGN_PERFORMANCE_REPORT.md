**`[surprise property management]` (Exact match):**
- **Bid:** $11.00 (same as Avondale winner)
- **Impressions:** 5 impressions
- **Clicks:** 0 clicks ❌
- **Problem:** People see your ad but aren't clicking (0% CTR)
- **Likely Cause:** 
  - Ad copy not compelling for this specific query
  - Ad position too low (not visible enough)
  - Ad not relevant to exact match search

**This is CRITICAL** - This should be your best keyword but it's getting ZERO clicks!

### 2. **Very Low Impression Share: 42.86%** 🚨
- **Avondale:** 77.42% impression share
- **Surprise:** 42.86% impression share (35% lower!)
- **Problem:** Not appearing in 57% of auctions you're eligible for
- **Cause:** Likely budget or bid constraints
- **Impact:** Missing 57% of potential clicks

### 3. **Zero Conversions**
- **Total:** 0 conversions in 11 days
- **Problem:** Only 3 clicks total - too small sample size
- **Issue:** Can't determine if campaign is working without conversions
- **Need:** More clicks to gather conversion data

### 4. **Competitors Outranking You** 🚨

### 5. **Avondale Keywords in Surprise Campaign** ❌
**Lines 29-51 show Avondale keywords mixed in:**
- `[property management avondale az]`
- `"property manager avondale az"`
- All marked "ad group removed" but still in the report
- **Action:** Clean up - remove all Avondale keywords from Surprise campaign

### 6. **Many Keywords with 0 Activity**
**Keywords with 0 impressions:**
- `[surprise property manager]` - $2.00 bid
- `[surprise rental property management]` - $0.01 bid (too low!)
- `[surprise property management company]` - $0.01 bid (too low - "below first page bid")
- `[property management surprise arizona]` - $2.00 bid

## 🎯 TOP PRIORITY RECOMMENDATION

### CRITICAL: Fix Winner Keyword First

**`[surprise property management]` is your most important keyword but it's broken:**

1. **Check ad copy** - Is it as compelling as Avondale's?
2. **Increase bid** to $12-13 (from $11) to get top position
3. **Review ad position** - Where is it showing? (Position 4-5 vs 1-2)
4. **Compare to Avondale** - What's different about Surprise ad?
5. **If still no clicks after bid increase** → Pause and focus on phrase match

### Then: Increase Budget

- **Current:** ~$2/day
- **Target:** $10-12/day (match Avondale)
- **Why:** Can't determine campaign viability with only 3 clicks total
