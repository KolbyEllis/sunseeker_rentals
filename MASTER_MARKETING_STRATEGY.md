**Current State:** Goodyear #16, all others 31+ (not in top 30)  
**Budget:** $500/month Google Ads

---

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### **Current Situation:**
- ✅ **Website:** Strong SEO foundation, 12 city pages, schema markup, 165+ reviews
- ✅ **Traffic:** ~683 new users/month (based on last 5 months average from 8.2K annual)
- ✅ **Form Submissions:** ~40 forms/month (200 forms in last 5 months)
- ✅ **Conversion Rate:** 5.85% (form submissions, based on last 5 months actual data)
- ⚠️ **Google Ads:** Performance Max campaign showing ads too broadly, including many tenant searches alongside property owner searches, needs better targeting control
- ❌ **Organic Rankings:** Only Goodyear visible (#16), all other cities beyond page 3
- ❌ **Competition:** RPM dominates #1 position in 11/12 cities, Rentals America #2 in all cities

### **Key Problems Identified:**
1. **Google Ads:** Performance Max targeting too broadly - showing ads on tenant searches (people looking to rent) in addition to property owner searches, diluting campaign effectiveness
2. **Organic SEO:** Not ranking despite good on-page optimization
3. **Competition:** Dominated by RPM (25+ years) and Rentals America (extensive portfolio)
4. **Content Gaps:** Missing competitive differentiators that competitors emphasize

### **Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Fix Google Ads immediately** - Switch from Performance Max to Search campaigns with proper targeting
2. **Enhance city page content** - Add competitive differentiators, guarantees, and stronger CTAs
3. **Build backlinks** - Improve domain authority to compete with RPM/Rentals America
4. **Local SEO optimization** - Google Business Profile, local citations, reviews

## 🎯 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### **Top 5 Competitors in Every City:**

**#1 Position (100% Dominance):**
- **Real Property Management Phoenix Valley (RPM)**
  - **Pricing:** $88/month (Standard) or $125/month (Platinum) + $400-$600 leasing
  - **USP:** 25+ years experience, long-term unfurnished rentals
  - **Guarantees:** 6-12 month tenant placement, eviction protection, happiness guarantee
  - **Weakness:** Generic messaging, not West Valley-specific

**#2 Position (100% Consistency):**
- **Rentals America Phoenix**
  - **Pricing:** $99/month + 50% of rent for leasing
  - **USP:** Full range of services, extensive portfolio
  - **Guarantees:** 90-day money-back, eviction protection, satisfaction guarantee
  - **Weakness:** Not West Valley-based, generic Valley-wide service

**#3 Position (Varies by City):**
- **Service Star Realty** (9 cities): $69-$199/month, "#1 Rental Managers" claim
- **PPG Property Management** (2 cities): 30-day lease guarantee or free month
- **Aloe Property Management** (Chandler only): Cost-effective positioning

**#4-5 Positions (Additional Key Competitors):**
- **PPG Property Management** (6 cities): 30-day lease guarantee (strong differentiator)

### **Your Competitive Advantages:**
✅ **28+ years** (beats RPM's 25+)  
✅ **165+ Google reviews** (most competitors don't highlight)  
✅ **4.5★ rating** (visible in schema)  
✅ **450+ properties managed** (proven scale)  
✅ **West Valley-based** (true local advantage vs. Valley-wide competitors)  
✅ **Family-owned** (personal touch vs. corporate)  
✅ **Transparent pricing** (vs. tiered/confusing structures)

### **Competitor Weaknesses to Exploit:**
1. **RPM:** Generic messaging, not West Valley-specific, 25 years (you have 28+)
2. **Rentals America:** Valley-wide service, not local, no West Valley focus
3. **Service Star:** "#1" claim is unsubstantiated, wide pricing range ($69-$199)
4. **Most competitors:** Don't highlight review counts, not family-owned, not West Valley-based

## 🚨 GOOGLE ADS: CRITICAL ISSUES & FIXES

### **Current Campaign Problems:**

**Performance Max Campaign Issues:**
- ⚠️ **No Keywords to Set:** Unlike Search campaigns where you choose keywords, Performance Max doesn't use keywords. Google automatically picks which searches trigger your ads based on your assets (headlines, descriptions, images) and landing page.
- ⚠️ **Google Chooses Search Matches:** Google uses machine learning to match your ads to searches it thinks are relevant, which is why you see such a wide variety of search terms - Google is trying to find any search it thinks might relate to your business.
- ⚠️ **Too Broad Targeting:** Performance Max is showing ads on searches that are too broad and include many tenant searches (people looking to rent), not just property owners
- ⚠️ **Irrelevant Search Matches:** Ads appearing on tenant searches like "houses for rent", "apartments for rent", "apartments under $1000 near me", "new house for rent near me"
- ⚠️ **Wrong Service Matches:** Ads matching to irrelevant searches like "rental realtors", "vacation rental", "commercial property management", "best free pm software"
- ⚠️ **Hidden Data:** 85.6% of clicks (4,826 out of 5,641) are from searches you can't see in the report
- ⚠️ **Limited Control:** Performance Max automatically matches ads across Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, etc. without giving you control over which searches trigger ads (you can only block searches with negative keywords)

**Search Terms Analysis (From Report):**
- **Total Campaign Performance:** 5,640 clicks, $2,937 spent
- **Visible Search Terms:** 815 clicks, $561 spent on searches you can see
- **Hidden Search Terms:** 4,826 clicks, $2,376 spent on searches Google doesn't show you
- **Relevant Searches (In Visible Terms):** Some good matches like "arizona property management", "property management services", "az prime property management" - showing Performance Max CAN find relevant searches
- **Problem:** Also matching to many tenant searches (people looking to rent, not manage properties) which dilutes targeting
- **CTR:** 1.20% (could be higher with better targeting)
- **CPC:** $0.52 (relatively low, but some clicks are low-value tenant searches)

### **IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:**

#### **Step 1: Add Negative Keywords (Do This First)**
Narrow your targeting by blocking irrelevant searches. Add negative keywords to prevent ads from showing on tenant searches and wrong service types. This applies whether you're keeping Performance Max or switching to Search campaigns.

**Tenant-Search Negatives (Add These):**
```
houses for rent
apartments for rent
studios for rent
places for rent
rental apartments
homes for rent
condos for rent
townhomes for rent
rent near me
apartments near me
homes available
credit friendly homes for rent
no background check apartments
apartments under $1000
rental apartments under $1000
```

**Wrong Service Negatives:**
```
realtor
real estate agent
short term rental
vacation rental
airbnb management
property manager job
property management staffing
property management software
```

**Wrong Location Negatives (If Not Served):**
```
lake havasu
scottsdale
cave creek
chino valley
```

**Competitor Name Negatives:**
```
stratton vantage
evernest
capstone realty
onq property management
ppg property management
cascade management
sky blue rentals
alo property management
equus management
gabriel management
king rentals
williams property management
copper valley property management
```

#### **Step 3: Create New Search Campaigns (Recommended)**

**Campaign Structure:**

**Campaign 1: West Valley Cities (Priority Markets)**
- **Budget:** $370/month (74% of total)
- **Ad Groups:** 7 (Goodyear, Glendale, Peoria, Avondale, Surprise, Buckeye, Litchfield Park)
- **Bidding:** Manual CPC or Target CPA (once conversions are tracked)

**Campaign 2: East Valley/Metro Cities (Secondary Markets)**
- **Budget:** $130/month (26% of total)
- **Ad Groups:** 5 (Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Tempe, Gilbert)
- **Bidding:** Manual CPC or Target CPA

**Each Ad Group Should Target Specific Keywords:**

**Primary Keywords (Exact Match) - Add for Each City:**
- "goodyear property management" (for Goodyear ad group)
- "glendale property management" (for Glendale ad group)
- "peoria property management" (for Peoria ad group)
- "[insert city name] property manager" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "property management [insert city name] az" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "property management [insert city name] arizona" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)

**Example for Goodyear Ad Group (Exact Match):**
```
"goodyear property management"
"goodyear property manager"
"property management goodyear az"
"property management goodyear arizona"
```

**Secondary Keywords (Phrase Match) - Add for Each City:**
- "[insert city name] property management company" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "property management services [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "residential property management [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "rental property management [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)

**Example for Goodyear Ad Group (Phrase Match):**
```
"goodyear property management company"
"property management services goodyear"
"residential property management goodyear"
"rental property management goodyear"
```

**Long-Tail Keywords (Broad Match Modified) - Add for Each City:**
- "how to find property manager [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "best property management [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "hire property manager [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)
- "property management near [insert city name]" (replace [insert city name] with actual city name)

**Example for Goodyear Ad Group (Broad Match Modified):**
```
+how +to +find +property +manager +goodyear
+best +property +management +goodyear
+hire +property +manager +goodyear
+property +management +near +goodyear
```

**Note:** Create separate ad groups for each of your 12 cities (Goodyear, Glendale, Peoria, Avondale, Surprise, Buckeye, Litchfield Park, Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Tempe, Gilbert) with city-specific keywords.

#### **Step 4: Set Up Conversion Tracking**

**Track These Actions:**
1. **Form Submissions** - Contact forms on city pages
2. **Phone Calls** - Call tracking (Google Call Extensions)
3. **Email Inquiries** - Email click tracking
4. **Quote Requests** - Specific form submissions

**Why This Matters:**
- Google needs conversion data to optimize
- Without conversions, it optimizes for wrong metrics (clicks)
- You can't measure ROI without conversion tracking

#### **Step 5: Create City-Specific Ad Copy**

**Ad Copy Template (Use for Each City):**

**Headline 1 (30 chars):** [insert city name] Property Management  
**Headline 2 (30 chars):** 28+ Years | 165+ Reviews  
**Headline 3 (30 chars):** West Valley-Based Experts

**Description 1 (90 chars):**
Expert [insert city name] property managers. Family-owned, 28+ years experience. 450+ properties managed. 165+ Google reviews. Get started today!

**Description 2 (90 chars):**
Maximize your [insert city name] rental income. West Valley-based, transparent pricing, thorough tenant screening. Free rental analysis available now.

**Path 1:** /[insert city name]-property-management  
**Path 2:** Get Started Today

**Ad Variations to Test:**

**Variation 1: Experience-Focused**
- Headline: "[insert city name] Property Management | 28+ Years"
- Description: "More experience than RPM. Family-owned, West Valley-based. 165+ reviews. Transparent pricing."

**Variation 2: Review-Focused**
- Headline: "[insert city name] Property Manager | 165+ Reviews"
- Description: "4.5★ rated with 165+ Google reviews. 450+ properties managed. West Valley experts. Call today!"

**Variation 3: Guarantee-Focused** (if you add guarantees)
- Headline: "[insert city name] Property Management | Guaranteed"
- Description: "30-day lease guarantee or free month. 28+ years experience. West Valley-based. Get started!"

**Variation 4: Local-Focused**
- Headline: "West Valley [insert city name] Property Manager"
- Description: "Based in Goodyear, serving all [insert city name] areas. 28+ years, 450+ properties, 165+ reviews. Local experts."

#### **Step 6: Budget Allocation (Revised)**

**West Valley Cities (Priority):**
| City | Monthly Budget | Daily Budget | Rationale |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Goodyear** | **$100** | **$3.33** | Best market, rank #16, maximize spend |
| Glendale | $65 | $2.17 | West Valley anchor, high search volume |
| Peoria | $55 | $1.83 | West Valley, growing market |
| Avondale | $45 | $1.50 | Adjacent to Goodyear, same team |
| Surprise | $40 | $1.33 | West Valley, strong demand |
| Buckeye | $35 | $1.17 | West Valley, growing |
| Litchfield Park | $30 | $1.00 | Premium market, smaller volume |
| **Subtotal** | **$370** | **$12.33** | **74% of budget** |

**East Valley/Metro Cities (Secondary):**
| City | Monthly Budget | Daily Budget | Rationale |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| Phoenix | $40 | $1.33 | Largest market, broad reach |
| Mesa | $30 | $1.00 | East Valley, still serve |
| Chandler | $25 | $0.83 | East Valley, affluent |
| Gilbert | $20 | $0.67 | East Valley |
| Tempe | $15 | $0.50 | East Valley, smaller budget |
| **Subtotal** | **$130** | **$4.33** | **26% of budget** |

**Total:** $500/month

## 🌐 WEBSITE CONTENT STRATEGY: COMPETE FOR TOP 2 PAGES

### **Current City Page Strengths:**
✅ Schema markup (LocalBusiness, FAQPage, Review)  
✅ Unique H1 headers with keywords  
✅ City-specific content sections  
✅ FAQ sections  
✅ Cross-linking between cities  
✅ 165+ reviews mentioned  
✅ 28+ years experience highlighted  
✅ 450+ properties managed mentioned

### **Content Gaps vs. Competitors:**

#### **Gap #1: Missing Guarantees**
**Competitors Offer:**
- RPM: 6-12 month tenant placement guarantee, eviction protection
- PPG: 30-day lease guarantee or free month
- HomeQwik: 6-month tenant guarantee
- Rentals America: 90-day money-back guarantee

**Your Pages:** No guarantees mentioned

**Recommendation:** Add guarantee section to each city page

#### **Gap #2: Pricing Not Prominent**
**Competitors:**
- Stratton Vantage: "$125/Month Flat Fee" in headline
- H&H Management: Detailed pricing breakdown
- Gerson Realty: "No leasing/vacancy fees" prominently displayed

**Your Pages:** Pricing not mentioned (transparency advantage not leveraged)

**Recommendation:** Add "Transparent Pricing" section or pricing callout

#### **Gap #3: Review Count Not Prominent Enough**
**Competitors:** Most don't highlight review counts  
**Your Advantage:** 165+ reviews (most competitors don't mention this)

**Recommendation:** Make review count more prominent in hero section

#### **Gap #4: West Valley Advantage Not Emphasized**
**Competitors:** RPM and Rentals America are Valley-wide, not West Valley-specific  
**Your Advantage:** Actually based in West Valley (Goodyear)

**Recommendation:** Emphasize "West Valley-Based" more prominently

#### **Gap #5: Family-Owned Not Emphasized**
**Competitors:** Most are corporate  
**Your Advantage:** Family-owned (personal touch)

**Recommendation:** Add "Family-Owned" badge or callout

### **Specific Content Additions Needed:**

#### **1. Add Guarantee Section (After "Why Choose Us" Section) ⚠️ SUGGESTION ONLY - NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Status:** This is a recommendation/suggestion only. Do not implement on website until you decide which guarantees you're willing to offer.

**Why This Matters:**
- Competitors (PPG, RPM, Rentals America) all offer guarantees
- Missing guarantees is a competitive disadvantage
- Guarantees increase trust and conversion rates
- However, only commit to guarantees you can actually deliver

**Guarantee Options to Consider:**

1. **30-Day Lease Guarantee** (Matches PPG's strong differentiator)
   - Pro: Very competitive, strong differentiator
   - Con: Requires confidence in quick tenant placement

2. **Eviction Protection** (Matches RPM/Rentals America)
   - Pro: Risk mitigation for property owners
   - Con: Financial risk if evictions occur

3. **Satisfaction Guarantee** (Matches Rentals America)
   - Pro: Low risk, builds trust
   - Con: None - you likely already allow cancellations

4. **Transparent Pricing Guarantee** (Already your advantage)
   - Pro: Zero risk, emphasizes existing strength
   - Con: None

**Recommendation:** Start with low-risk guarantees (#3 and #4), then consider adding #1 and #2 after evaluating operational feasibility.
