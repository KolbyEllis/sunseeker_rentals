## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Problem #1: Massive Waste on Irrelevant Search Terms**

**The Numbers Don't Add Up:**
- **Campaign Total:** 5,641 clicks, 469,609 impressions
- **Visible Search Terms:** Only 815 clicks, 7,443 impressions
- **Missing Data:** **4,826 clicks (85.6% of total)** are "hidden" or unaccounted for

This means Google is spending money on searches you can't see, and they're likely very poor quality.

### **Problem #2: Performance Max Is Targeting Completely Wrong Searches**

**Bad Search Terms You're Getting Clicks From:**
1. ❌ "surprise realtor" - Wrong service (you're property management, not a realtor)
2. ❌ "short term rental management" - You do long-term rentals
3. ❌ "houses for rent surprise az" - Tenant searches, not owner searches
4. ❌ "condos" - Too generic, no intent
5. ❌ "studios for rent near me" - Tenant search
6. ❌ "places for rent near me" - Tenant search
7. ❌ "rental apartments under $1000" - Tenant search, wrong audience
8. ❌ "vacation property manager" - Wrong service type
9. ❌ "lake havasu house rentals" - Wrong location (outside your service area)
10. ❌ "no background check apartments phoenix az" - Wrong audience entirely

**The Pattern:** Your ads are showing to people looking to **RENT properties**, not people looking to **MANAGE their rental properties**. These are two completely different audiences!

### **Problem #3: Broad Targeting Diluting Performance**

- **Visible Search Terms Show:** Mix of relevant property management searches and tenant searches
- **Issue:** Performance Max is casting too wide a net, matching to tenant searches (people looking to rent) in addition to property owner searches
- **Impact:** This broad targeting means some of your ad spend is going to people who are looking for rentals, not property management services
- **Solution:** Add negative keywords to narrow targeting and focus on property owners

## 📊 PERFORMANCE BREAKDOWN

### **Search Terms With Actual Clicks:**

**The Good (Few and Far Between):**
1. ✅ "condominium management phoenix az"
   - 2 clicks, $2.86 cost, $1.43 CPC
   - **This is correct** - property owner looking for management

2. ✅ "property management companies tempo arizona" 
   - 1 click, $0.54 cost, 50% CTR
   - Typo in search ("tempo" vs "tempe") but correct intent

**The Questionable:**
3. ⚠️ "credit friendly homes for rent"
   - 2 clicks, $3.62 cost, $1.81 CPC
   - Could be owner OR tenant - unclear intent

4. ⚠️ "homes available near me"
   - 1 click, $0.12 cost, 100% CTR
   - Likely a tenant search, not owner

### **Search Terms With Impressions But No Clicks (Waste):**

Thousands of impressions on irrelevant terms:
- "cascade management"
- "sky blue rentals"
- "alo property management"
- "east valley"
- "equus management company az"
- "gabriel management"
- "king rentals property management"
- "goodyear apartments for rent" (4 impressions, 0 clicks)
- "williams property management"
- "cave creek property management"
- "copper valley property management"
- "house for rent in lake havasu city az"
- "no background check apartments phoenix az"
- "property management company" (generic, likely wrong intent)
- "rent right"
- "prime property management"
- "evernest phoenix"
- "capstone realty"
- "stratton vantage" (competitor name!)
- And hundreds more...

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### **Why This Is Happening:**

1. **Performance Max Campaign Type:**
   - Performance Max is Google's fully automated campaign type
   - It automatically targets across Search, Display, YouTube, Gmail, Discover, and Maps
   - **Problem:** It's optimizing for clicks/engagement, not conversions
   - **Problem:** It has too much freedom to show ads on irrelevant searches

2. **Lack of Negative Keywords:**
   - No negative keywords visible in the report
   - Google is matching to any search that might be "relevant"
   - Terms like "houses for rent", "apartments", "studios" should be negative keywords

3. **No Conversion Tracking:**
   - 0 conversions suggests conversion tracking isn't set up
   - Performance Max needs conversion data to optimize properly
   - Without conversions, it optimizes for clicks (which is why you're getting tenant searches)

4. **Broad Targeting:**
   - Performance Max is casting too wide a net
   - It's showing ads to anyone searching property/rental-related terms
   - Not filtering for property owners vs. tenants

## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### **Priority 1: Add Negative Keywords (Do This NOW)**

Add these as negative keywords to stop wasting money:

**Tenant-Search Negatives:**
- "houses for rent"
- "apartments for rent"
- "studios for rent"
- "places for rent"
- "rental apartments"
- "homes for rent"
- "condos for rent"
- "townhomes for rent"
- "rent near me"
- "apartments near me"
- "homes available"
- "credit friendly homes for rent"
- "no background check apartments"

**Wrong Service Negatives:**
- "realtor"
- "real estate agent"
- "short term rental"
- "vacation rental"
- "airbnb management"
- "property manager job"
- "property management staffing"
- "property management software"

**Wrong Location Negatives:**
- "lake havasu"
- "scottsdale" (if you don't serve it)
- "cave creek"
- "chino valley"

**Competitor Name Negatives:**
- "stratton vantage"
- "evernest"
- "capstone realty"
- "onq property management"
- "ppg property management"

### **Priority 2: Switch to Search Campaign (Not Performance Max)**

**Performance Max Problems:**
- Too automated
- Hard to control where ads show
- Shows on Display/YouTube/Gmail where property owners aren't
- Can't easily add negative keywords
- Optimizes for clicks, not conversions

**Search Campaign Benefits:**
- Full control over keywords
- Only shows on Google Search
- Easy to add negative keywords
- Can target exact search intent
- Better for property management (B2B service)

### **Priority 3: Set Up Conversion Tracking**

**You Need to Track:**
- Form submissions (contact forms on your website)
- Phone calls (call tracking)
- Email inquiries
- Quote requests

**Why This Matters:**
- Google needs conversion data to optimize
- Without conversions, it optimizes for wrong metrics (clicks)
- You can't measure ROI without conversion tracking

### **Priority 4: Create Targeted Keyword Lists**

**Instead of Performance Max, create Search Campaigns with:**

**Primary Keywords (Exact Match):**
- "goodyear property management"
- "glendale property management"
- "phoenix property management"
- "mesa property management"
- "chandler property management"
- "tempe property management"
- "gilbert property management"
- "peoria property management"
- "surprise property management"
- "buckeye property management"
- "avondale property management"
- "litchfield park property management"

**Secondary Keywords (Phrase Match):**
- "[city] property manager"
- "property management [city] az"
- "property management company [city]"
- "rental property management [city]"
- "residential property management [city]"

**Long-Tail Keywords (Broad Match Modified):**
- "how to find property manager [city]"
- "best property management [city]"
- "property management services [city]"
- "hire property manager [city]"

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

### **After Fixes, You Should See:**

1. **Higher CTR:** Targeting owners instead of tenants = better match = higher CTR
2. **Lower CPC:** More relevant searches = higher Quality Score = lower CPC
3. **Conversions:** Actually getting property owners = actual leads
4. **Better ROI:** Spending money on right audience = return on investment

### **Current Performance:**
- CTR: 1.20% (low - wrong audience)
- CPC: $0.52 (low because clicks are low-value)
- Conversions: 0 (wrong audience)

### **Expected After Fixes:**
- CTR: 3-5% (better targeting)
- CPC: $2-5 (higher but worth it for conversions)
- Conversions: Actual leads from property owners
- ROI: Positive (leads turning into customers)

---

## 💰 COST ANALYSIS

### **Current Performance:**
- **Total Spent:** $2,936.15
- **Total Clicks:** 5,641
- **Visible Search Terms:** 815 clicks, $561 spent (can see which searches)
- **Hidden Search Terms:** 4,826 clicks, $2,376 spent (Google doesn't show these searches)
- **Issue:** Many visible searches are tenant-related ("houses for rent", "apartments for rent") which are not the target audience
- **Good Searches:** Some relevant searches like "arizona property management", "property management services" are getting clicks
- **Recommendation:** Add negative keywords to narrow targeting and focus spend on property owner searches

### **If You Fix This:**
- Spend $500/month on RIGHT audience
- Get 10-20 quality leads/month
- Even at 10% conversion = 1-2 customers/month
- At $3k/year per customer = $3k-$6k/month revenue
- **ROI: 600-1200%**

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED CAMPAIGN STRUCTURE

### **Campaign 1: West Valley Cities (Goodyear, Buckeye, Surprise, Litchfield Park, Avondale, Peoria, Glendale)**
- Budget: $250/month
- Focus: Your best markets
- Keywords: "[city] property management" for each city

### **Campaign 2: East Valley Cities (Phoenix, Mesa, Chandler, Tempe, Gilbert)**
- Budget: $250/month
- Keywords: "[city] property management" for each city

### **Each Campaign Should Have:**
- Separate ad groups for each city
- City-specific ad copy
- Negative keywords list (shared across all)
- Conversion tracking enabled
- Manual CPC or Target CPA bidding (not Performance Max)

---

## 🚨 URGENT NEXT STEPS

1. **Add negative keywords to Performance Max** - Block tenant searches and wrong service types (do this first)
2. **Review search terms weekly** - Continue adding new negatives as irrelevant searches appear
3. **Ensure conversion tracking is set up** - Track forms, phone calls, and other conversions
4. **Consider creating Search campaigns** (optional) - For more control over which searches trigger ads
5. **Monitor performance after adding negatives** - See if targeting improves
6. **Continue refining** - Add negatives regularly based on search terms report

---

**Bottom Line:** Performance Max is showing your ads too broadly - matching to tenant searches (people looking to rent apartments) in addition to property owner searches. While some relevant searches are getting clicks, the broad targeting means ad spend is being diluted across irrelevant searches.

The good news: This is fixable. By adding negative keywords, you can narrow the targeting and focus your spend on property owners who need management services, not tenants looking for rentals.
